  Hi, this webpage revolves around Python implementation of chemistry and physics problems. Additionally, you may also find content regarding computer-oriented mathematics.
</p>

Few words about myself. Normally, I would like to keep a low profile and stay anonymous. However, over the pandemic, I have been nurturing the idea of opening up myself and interacting more. So, this is my first step to connect with the people around me. So `Hello, World!`. My initial motivation in creating this webpage is to organize my homework better. I tried to put it into action last year but the passion exponentially decayed with time. Hence, to keep myself on track this time, I decide to have an audience. Also I'm just unexperienced in programming so I really hope to receive suggestions/corrections from you! Discussions are, of course, always welcomed. 

All that being said, I will structure my webpage into 3 parts as following:
* **Science** (*e.g. Statistical Thermodynamics, Kinetics, Molecular Dynamics, etc*)
* **Math** (*Alogorithms for Interpolation, Integration, ODE, etc*)
* **Others** (*Stuffs that I find interesting and about which I want to share my perspective*)
