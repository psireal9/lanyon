Sometimes i feel like im walking on a sphere, a surface of positivity, even though the sky was so gray. For me, the concept of time fails to be tangible. Years of events condense into a tiny spot on the arrow of time. Not a popular opinion but I don't like taking decent photographs. Like I need to have this strong urge to capture this specific moment, whose composition is so ineffable that it would not reemerge somewhere else ever again. I haven't experienced that urge. Everything is just passing by interminably. I hardly look back at photos and when I do, the emotions woven in them stay covert to me. On rainy days, I yearn for an armchair and a turntable.
