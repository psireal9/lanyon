I ran with all my might. I could see all the faces I ran past. There were some familiar ones appearing somewhat blurred under the glare of the parallel streetlights. I kept pushing forward. 'Do you feel like you are being followed?'. I was staring the window behind him and he snapped me back to the reality. 'No', I answered. There was this package that I carried around with me in my backpack for a whole week. I couldn't bring myself to have it posted. Faces turn into silhouette. I couldn't stop running. In an amusing way, I think the names of Interstellar's soundtracks really capture my sentiment precisely and concisely. I put 'The Cornfield Chase' on loop and erase the memories.
